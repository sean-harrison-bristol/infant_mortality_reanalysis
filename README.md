Re-analysis of infant mortality trends 2010-2017 using ONS data

A re-analysis the paper "Assessing the impact of rising child poverty on the unprecedented rise in infant mortality in England, 2000â€“2017: time trend analysis"
I wanted to see whether there has been changes to infant mortality rate trends in England between 2010 and 2017, and if so, at what ages, and whether deprivation caused it.

All data freely available from the ONS, but included in the raw data folder.

The complete code is available as a .do file (Stata code) - the analysis.dta file has everything needed for the analyses to run.
